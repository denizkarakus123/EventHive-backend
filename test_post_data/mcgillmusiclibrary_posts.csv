For details and to register for the event, see the link in bio üëÜ

In the fall of 1959 Norma Beecroft, a twenty-five-year-old composition student, left her home in Toronto and travelled to Rome to study with the eminent Italian composer Goffredo Petrassi. She left behind her lover and mentor, the thirty-four-year-old Harry Somers, by then recognized as one of Canada‚Äôs leading young composers. For the next five-and-a-half months they wrote each other almost every day. Somers soon came to realize that he wanted Beecroft to give up her studies and return to Toronto to marry him. Despite this pressure, however, she ultimately chose to remain in Italy to study and compose, thus rejecting a conventional woman‚Äôs role. Their intense and intimate correspondence documents lives lived apart but shared on the page, until the relationship ended abruptly in February 1960. As well, the letters show both composers at pivotal moments in their careers, working on their own creative projects and experiencing the music and culture in their respective environments. Beyond illuminating the evolution of their personal relationship, these wide-ranging letters not only provide much insight into the state of contemporary music in both Europe and Canada, but also evoke for the reader the general state of Canadian arts and culture in the late 1950s.

For details and to register for the event, see the link in bio üëÜ
 
Cadence is a comprehensive examination of how formal units in European art music of the tonal era achieve closure. Rooted in Caplin's broader ‚Äútheory of formal functions,‚Äù the book develops concepts of cadence for music of the high classical style and then extends these ideas to gauge cadential practice in earlier and later style periods. Throughout the study, various manifestations of cadence are defined in terms of their harmonic-melodic morphology as well as their formal function. The book introduces a host of theoretical concepts illustrated by more than seven hundred musical examples, all of which contain extensive analytical annotations of harmony, melody, cadence, and form.
