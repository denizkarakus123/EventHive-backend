We urgently request your attendance at a general assembly over zoom on Wednesday, November 20th at 5:30PM to vote on a motion supporting a student body strike on November 21st & 22nd. This collective strike, taking place across universities and CEGEPs in MontrÃ©al, is advocating for institutional divestment from McGillâ€™s holdings in military and defense infrastructure being used to enact a genocide on Palestinians residing in Gaza and the West Bank. Unethical investments include $2.2 million in Airbus Aerospace (surveillance), $1.3 million in BAE systems (military contractor), and $500,000 in Lockheed Martin (weapons manufacturer). 

Several McGill Arts departments are also currently voting to enact this motion, including Anthropology, Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, and Environment. 

The AHCSSA Executive team has elected to bring this motion to a general assembly meeting open to all art history and communication studies majors and minors to form a collective decision. We are hoping to receive a vote from at least 8% of our student population, so please spread the word and encourage your peers to attend! 

Please use the link in our bio to join the meeting tomorrow. In the meantime, please email us at ahcssamcgill@gmail.com with any questions. 

Best Regards, 
AHCSSA Executive Team",1732046138,2024-11-19 19:55:38

Are you in your first year and have no idea how to navigate the complicated world that is a bachelors degree (weâ€™ve all been there). Need help picking courses, planning your degree or choosing a minor ? Or are you in your upper year of study and have no idea what to do with your degree or are considering honours, etc ? 

If you answered yes to any of these questions, come to our Q&A session in everyoneâ€™s favourite classroom (Arts w-215) on November 25 @ 5:30 !! This is a great opportunity to ask your questions and meet fellow students. Hope to see you thereðŸ’«ðŸ’«",1731955483,2024-11-18 18:44:43
