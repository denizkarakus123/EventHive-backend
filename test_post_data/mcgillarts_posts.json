        "description": "In a world where students rely more and more on digital technology and AI for learning, English majors Avryl Bender and Jayda Smith were tasked with \u201cresearching the ungoogleable\u201d during their summer internship with Poetry Matters. \n\r\nDuring their internship, Avryl and Jayda conducted research on Dr. Barbara Althea Jones\u2014a Trinidadian-born poet, plant geneticist, and professor at McGill during the sixties. \n\r\n\u201cIn the archive, time moved differently. Gradually, the past and present seemed to fold into each other. Both of us remember particular moments when the archive prompted us to feel that we really knew Jones,\u201d Avryl and Jayda share their experience working in the Barbara Althea Jones fonds within the McGill University Archives. \n\r\nKeep an eye out on the Poetry Matters website (https://www.mcgill.ca/poetrymatters/) for Avryl and Jayda\u2019s forthcoming portrait of Dr. Barbara Althea Jones and make sure to read the full article via the link in our bio. \r\n\n#mcgill #mcgillarts #poetrymatters #artsinternship",
