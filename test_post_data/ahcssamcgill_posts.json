        "description": "Dear Art History & Communication Studies undergraduate students, \n\nWe urgently request your attendance at a general assembly over zoom on Wednesday, November 20th at 5:30PM to vote on a motion supporting a student body strike on November 21st & 22nd. This collective strike, taking place across universities and CEGEPs in Montr\u00e9al, is advocating for institutional divestment from McGill\u2019s holdings in military and defense infrastructure being used to enact a genocide on Palestinians residing in Gaza and the West Bank. Unethical investments include $2.2 million in Airbus Aerospace (surveillance), $1.3 million in BAE systems (military contractor), and $500,000 in Lockheed Martin (weapons manufacturer). \n\nSeveral McGill Arts departments are also currently voting to enact this motion, including Anthropology, Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, and Environment. \n\nThe AHCSSA Executive team has elected to bring this motion to a general assembly meeting open to all art history and communication studies majors and minors to form a collective decision. We are hoping to receive a vote from at least 8% of our student population, so please spread the word and encourage your peers to attend! \n\nPlease use the link in our bio to join the meeting tomorrow. In the meantime, please email us at ahcssamcgill@gmail.com with any questions. \n\nBest Regards, \nAHCSSA Executive Team",
