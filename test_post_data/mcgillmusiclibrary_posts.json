        "description": "The Music Library will be hosting a book launch on Friday, November 29, from 5:30pm to 7:30pm, to celebrate the publication of Between Composers: The Letters of Norma Beecroft and Harry Somers (McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press, 2024) by Prof. Brian Cherney.\n\nFor details and to register for the event, see the link in bio \ud83d\udc46\n\nIn the fall of 1959 Norma Beecroft, a twenty-five-year-old composition student, left her home in Toronto and travelled to Rome to study with the eminent Italian composer Goffredo Petrassi. She left behind her lover and mentor, the thirty-four-year-old Harry Somers, by then recognized as one of Canada\u2019s leading young composers. For the next five-and-a-half months they wrote each other almost every day. Somers soon came to realize that he wanted Beecroft to give up her studies and return to Toronto to marry him. Despite this pressure, however, she ultimately chose to remain in Italy to study and compose, thus rejecting a conventional woman\u2019s role. Their intense and intimate correspondence documents lives lived apart but shared on the page, until the relationship ended abruptly in February 1960. As well, the letters show both composers at pivotal moments in their careers, working on their own creative projects and experiencing the music and culture in their respective environments. Beyond illuminating the evolution of their personal relationship, these wide-ranging letters not only provide much insight into the state of contemporary music in both Europe and Canada, but also evoke for the reader the general state of Canadian arts and culture in the late 1950s.\n\nPlease join us in celebrating the publication of Between Composers on November 29. Professor Cherney will speak about and read from his new book.",

        "description": "The Music Library will be hosting a book launch on Friday, November 22, from 5:30 to 7:30pm, to celebrate the new publication of Cadence: A Study of Closure in Tonal Music (Oxford University Press, 2024) by William Caplin, Distinguished James McGill Professor Emeritus. \n\nFor details and to register for the event, see the link in bio \ud83d\udc46\n \nCadence is a comprehensive examination of how formal units in European art music of the tonal era achieve closure. Rooted in Caplin's broader \u201ctheory of formal functions,\u201d the book develops concepts of cadence for music of the high classical style and then extends these ideas to gauge cadential practice in earlier and later style periods. Throughout the study, various manifestations of cadence are defined in terms of their harmonic-melodic morphology as well as their formal function. The book introduces a host of theoretical concepts illustrated by more than seven hundred musical examples, all of which contain extensive analytical annotations of harmony, melody, cadence, and form. \n \nPlease join us in celebrating the publication of Cadence: A Study of Closure in Tonal Music. Professor Caplin will speak about his new book and copies will be available for purchase at a discount.",
