During their internship, Avryl and Jayda conducted research on Dr. Barbara Althea Jones‚Äîa Trinidadian-born poet, plant geneticist, and professor at McGill during the sixties. 

‚ÄúIn the archive, time moved differently. Gradually, the past and present seemed to fold into each other. Both of us remember particular moments when the archive prompted us to feel that we really knew Jones,‚Äù Avryl and Jayda share their experience working in the Barbara Althea Jones fonds within the McGill University Archives. 

Keep an eye out on the Poetry Matters website (https://www.mcgill.ca/poetrymatters/) for Avryl and Jayda‚Äôs forthcoming portrait of Dr. Barbara Althea Jones and make sure to read the full article via the link in our bio.

It was during her time as a graduate student at Yale University that Owens came across a photograph of Oscar Moore, who would grace the cover of her first book years later. 

Oscar Moore, a black, blind child who performed across American stages as a prodigy during the 1880s-1890s, prompted Owens to look into the status and treatment of black children in both its historical and contemporary context. 

‚ÄúUpon finding [this picture of Moore], I immediately wanted to know who Moore was, and why, in a period where white supremacists were relentlessly questioning black intelligence, this child‚Äôs intelligence‚Äîor ‚Äúbrightness‚Äù‚Äîheld entertainment value for white Americans,‚Äù says Owens.
