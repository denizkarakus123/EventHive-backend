        "description": "After a vote and general assembly yesterday evening, the undergraduate student body has decided to vote YES on supporting the Student Strike for Palestine.\n\nLINGUA affiliated students have agreed to hold an undergraduate, department-wide strike on\nNovember 21st and 22nd. Students may stand outside classrooms or the Linguistics Building to inform other students of the strike happening. Students will be encouraged to participate in or organize demonstrations on campus in collaboration with the broader \u201cStudent Strike for Palestine\u201d movement. Students are encouraged to make announcements of the strike on November 21st and 22nd in their respective linguistics classes. This will be a soft picket. No one will be blocked from attending academic activities.\n\nThus, we encourage all lingustics students to join in striking for a Free Palestine and to call on McGill to divest from Israeli investments, and the university\u2019s investments in military and defense infrastructure.",

        "description": "This Friday\u2019s talk: Karlos Arregi (University of Chicago): The relation between head movement and periphrasis.\n\n\u201cIn joint work with Asia Pietraszko, I\u2019ve been investigating the relation between head movement and the synthesis-periphrasis distinction in the verbal domain. We use the term \u201csynthesis\u201d to refer to verbal expressions in which the lexical verb bears all the verbal inflection in a clause (e.g. \u201crode\u201d in English). In contrast, a periphrastic verbal expression additionally contains an auxiliary verb (specifically, \u201cbe\u201d or \u201chave\u201d), and verbal inflection is distributed between the lexical verb and the auxiliary (e.g. \u201chad ridden\u201d). We argue for two crosslinguistic generalizations: AfTonomy and *V-Aux. According to AfTonomy, affixal Ts vary as to whether they are in a head movement relation with a verb. *V-Aux states that in periphrasis, the lexical verb and the auxiliary cannot be related by head movement. Existing analyses of periphrasis can account for one or the other generalization, but not for both. We further argue that this tension between the two generalizations is resolved if we adopt the hypothesis that both head movement and periphrasis are tied to selection. More specifically, we propose that head movement is parasitic on a selectional relation (following Svenonius 1994, Julien 2002, Matushansky 2006, and Preminger 2019) and that auxiliaries are merged as specifiers selected by functional heads such as T (Pietraszko 2017).\u201d\n\nAs per usual, all are welcome! Come see what research professors at other universities are conducting\u2014colloquiums are an excellent opportunity for students to learn about diverse topics and get a sense for linguistics academia.",

I\u2019ll survey evidence my SAVANT team (https://savant.qmul.ac.uk/) and I have now collected from 7 languages (with 3 more in progress) that is consistent with a successive cyclic Y model of grammar, in which initial syntactic composition precedes and feeds subsequent interpretation, and word internal processes rely on the same neural resources and mechanisms as sentential processes.\u201d",
